# Meal Planner
This project is a python based command line application to automate meal planning. A focus on reducing food waste motivated the creation of this project.

- Weighted meal choices based on ingredients you already have, and a calculated 'freshness' value based on their expiry date.
- Randomly selected meals, no repeats on consecutive weeks, add recipe tags to prevent similar meals on consecutive days

# Future Ideas
- Allow for automated ingredient tracking via recipt scanning
- Import recipes via url
- Web interface to improve user experience
- Integration with recipe search api for in app recipe searching
